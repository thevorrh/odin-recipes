            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>parchment paper</li>
            <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1 tsp dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <!-- ordered list of execution steps -->
        <ol>
            <li>Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour on a shallow plate. Place beaten eggs into a shallow bowl. Combine grated Parmesan cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and 1 tsp smoked paprika, and place on a second shallow plate.</li>
            <li>Cover a dinner plate or platter with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Dip each lightly seasoned chicken breast tender in flour, shaking off the excess.Next, dip in beaten egg, and hold the tender over the eggs to allow excess to drip back into the bowl.Place each tender on the panko mixture. With dry fingers, scoop panko mix over the tender, patting the crumbs in. Place on teh parchment-covered plate.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining chicken tenders, until all tenders are breaded with flour, egg, and panko mix.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is bubbling. Add tenders, 1 at a time, being careful not to crowd the skillet. You may need to cook chicken in 2 batches.Cook until breading is browned and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side, being careful not to burn the breading.</li>
            <li>Turn tenders when the crust is nicely browned and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserter into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Adjust heat down a notch or two, if the crust is getting too brown, and add a bit more oil or butter, if the skillet looks dry. Remove cooked chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
            <li> Add garlic to the skillet, and stir until garlic is fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Deglaze skillet with white wine, stirring up all the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Season Italian herb seasoning blend and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li> Stir in cream and heat over medium high. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring frequently, and adjust flavor with salt and pepper, if needed. Allow sauce to bubble until desired consistency is achieved, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return cooked chicken tenders to the skillet and warm in the sauce, about 1 minute. Garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
